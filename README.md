## 🚀 About the Project

**Ask-Her-for-date** is a playful, lighthearted HTML/CSS/JavaScript project that turns the act of asking someone out into an **interactive mini-game**.  
Instead of a boring "Yes" or "No" message, it uses **fun button animations, dynamic text changes, and sneaky design tricks** to make the experience both **funny and engaging**.

The project is designed to:
- Entertain and surprise the person you’re asking
- Showcase creative **front-end web design** skills
- Demonstrate **DOM manipulation** and interactive UI logic

**Core Concept**  
The "No" button might move away when hovered over, while the "Yes" button remains easy to click. The text updates dynamically, and additional animations make the proposal memorable.

**Why It’s Fun**  
- It’s impossible to click “No” without a fight 😏
- The app uses animations to increase anticipation
- It can be customized with your own colors, text, and effects
